2d spritekit game idea

This is my very first SpriteKit game. It was built with mostly opensource assets but I have some that was created by me. The gameplay is boring yet but I'm trying to improve.
Also I'm a beginner coder so there will be a lot of mistakes and other trash in the code.

The idea is to create an infinite runner like Flappy Bird was. I have a thief escapeing from the crime scene on the rooftops of a city. Randomly spawned coins or cops are waiting on the rooftops. I'm planning to implement chasing enemies later, I juts don't know hot to do this yet.

Feel free to play with the code!
